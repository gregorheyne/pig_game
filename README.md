# Pig Dice Game

- implementation following "Neller, Presser - Optimal play of pig"
    - e.g. here: https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=csfac 


- TODO:
    - plot decision boundary (to compare to some of the plots in Neller, Presser)
    - optimize/vectorize (get rid of some(/all?) of the loops)
