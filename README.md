# Pig Dice Game

- implementation of deriving optimal strategy for Pig Game following theory in  "Neller, Presser - Optimal play of pig"
    - e.g. here: https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&context=csfac 


- TODO:
    - set viewing angle on 3d-plot
    - make plot that shows the evolution of p-hold and p-roll for a given score_2 and score 1 along k (does that make sense? think about which dimension is interesting)
    - run 6-sided dice 50 game to see the decision boundary
